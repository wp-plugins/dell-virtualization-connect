Virtualization Connect is a widget/plugin that helps connect cloud computing blogs around the World.

== Description ==

Virtualization Connect is a widget/plugin that helps connect virtualization blogs around the World. The widget is a
content aggregator for virtualization blog articles. The aggregator takes content from the highest quality
virtualization blogs and presents the titles and a brief summary within the widget.

The widget has a special crawler that goes to a pre-set list of virtualization blogs that are selected based on
content quality. It then takes the title of the latest articles written by that blog and populates the widget
sitting on the installer's website. Articles within the widget are then ranked based on a variety of social media
factors to present only the best freshest articles.

The goal of the Virtualization Connect widget it to help users and publishers to discover new content and readers. Our hope is
to help technologists discover new virtualization technology along with connect with other industry leaders to share best practices.
